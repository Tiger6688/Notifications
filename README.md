A work-in-progress application to demonstrate [ReactiveCocoa's Swift API](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/pull/1382) and exercise other Swift libraries, like [LlamaKit](https://github.com/LlamaKit/LlamaKit).

Even if it works, this app is built for pedagogy and experimentation—_not_ production—so it will never be full-featured.

Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).
